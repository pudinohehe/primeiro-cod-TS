# CineLogic TS

## About the Project
A lightweight movie catalog system designed to track films I've watched and those on my future watchlist.

## Goal
To deepen my **TypeScript** expertise by building a robust tool for tracking watched movies, ratings, and metadata.

## Technologies
* **TypeScript** (Static Typing and Interfaces)
* **Node.js** (Runtime Environment)
* **Git/GitHub** (Professional Version Control)

## Key Learnings
In this project, I applied the following concepts:
1. **Array Manipulation**: Advanced use of `.filter()` and `.find()` methods.
2. **Memory Reference**: Modifying objects within lists while maintaining data integrity.
3. **Error Handling**: Implementing logical checks to prevent system crashes when searching for non-existent items.
